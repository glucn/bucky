### Docs vs implementation gaps
- The user story and requirements say users can edit rows before import and decide per‑row import/skip/modify, but the UI is read‑only and duplicate handling is all‑or‑nothing. See doc/F-008-offline-import-foundation/requirements.md, src/renderer/components/ImportTransactionsWizard.tsx. (NOTE: we should update the docs according to the recent changes)
- Duplicate detection criteria mismatch: requirements specify date+amount+description, while service dedup also includes accounts and currency; UI uses only date+amount+description and only within the CSV. See doc/F-008-offline-import-foundation/requirements.md, src/renderer/utils/importMapping.ts, src/services/database.ts. (NOTE: this should also be a problem with the docs)
- Auditability in UI session is a requirement, but there’s no import session log or skipped‑row listing shown to the user. See doc/F-008-offline-import-foundation/requirements.md, src/renderer/components/ImportTransactionsWizard.tsx. (NOTE: is this "import log" implemented as a step after import?)

### Significant UI/UX issues
- Duplicates are only actionable after a failed import pass, and the dialog is hidden if all rows are duplicates (success state never shows). This makes “force import” impossible in the all‑duplicate case. See src/renderer/components/ImportTransactionsWizard.tsx.
- The preview duplicates badge highlights duplicates within the file, not against existing data, which can mislead users into thinking the system has checked the ledger. See src/renderer/utils/importMapping.ts, src/renderer/components/ImportTransactionsWizard.tsx.
- “Skipped details below” is promised but never shown. Users can’t tell which rows failed or why unless they inspect logs. See src/renderer/components/ImportTransactionsWizard.tsx.
- Auto‑mapping is applied immediately with no explicit “confirm suggestions,” which conflicts with the requirement of “never auto‑apply without confirmation.” This is a UX expectation mismatch. See doc/F-008-offline-import-foundation/requirements.md, src/renderer/components/ImportTransactionsWizard.tsx.
- The “To Account” mapping label implies transfers, but in practice it can be a category name and may auto‑create categories without user confirmation. This is confusing and risky from an accounting perspective. See src/renderer/components/ImportTransactionsWizard.tsx, src/main/index.ts.
- The stepper visually omits the connector between Preview and Confirm (idx < 2), which makes progress feel broken. See src/renderer/components/ImportTransactionsWizard.tsx.
- Amount parsing only strips commas; currency symbols, parentheses, and localized formats will quietly fail and only surface as import errors. This is a UX paper‑cut with real data. See src/renderer/utils/importMapping.ts.
